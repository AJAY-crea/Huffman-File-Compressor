# üì¶ Huffman-File-Compressor

This project provides a **C++ implementation of the Huffman Encoding algorithm** for **lossless file compression and decompression**. It supports **any binary or text file**, efficiently reducing file sizes while preserving exact data.

---

## üß† Features

- ‚úÖ Binary-safe compression and decompression
- ‚úÖ Stores custom frequency metadata for accurate decoding
- ‚úÖ Supports all file formats: `.txt`, `.png`, `.exe`, etc.
- ‚úÖ Efficient memory usage and bitstream management
- ‚úÖ Command-line interface with clear error handling

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

Use `g++` to compile:

```bash
# Compile the compressor
g++ compressor.cpp -o compressor

# Compile the decompressor
g++ decompressor.cpp -o decompressor.exe
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

### üîê Compress a file

```bash
./compressor input.txt compressed.txt
```

### üîì Decompress a file

```bash
./decompressor.exe compressed.txt decompressed.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that:
> - `input.txt` exists
> - `compressed.txt` is writable
> - Executables (`compressor`, `decompressor.exe`) are compiled properly

## üìÇ File Structure

| File                  | Purpose                                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `compressor.cpp`      | Main file for compression                        |
| `decompressor.cpp`    | Main file for decompression                      |
| `huffman_decoder.cpp` | Core Huffman logic (shared by both executables)  |

---

## üìä Compression Format Details

Each compressed file includes:
- Header with frequency data (used for reconstructing the Huffman Tree)
- Encoded binary stream
- Padding info (so bits align to byte boundaries)

---

## ‚úÖ Example Run

```bash
./compressor test.txt compressed.huff
./decompressor compressed.huff restored.txt
diff test.txt restored.txt   # No output ‚Üí files are identical
```
